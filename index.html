                        I am a dedicated and organized person who values ​​knowledge and constant development. I study every day, always seeking to learn new things. I take care of my health with discipline, going to the gym regularly and playing sports to maintain physical and mental balance.

I enjoy reading books and exploring different genres, in addition to having several other hobbies that enrich my free time. I am focused on managing my time efficiently, balancing studies, physical activities and leisure to achieve my goals and tasks responsibly.

        <h3>courses</h3>
            <p>
                I am currently studying Systems Analysis and Development at (UNINASSAU ARACAJU), where I have dedicated myself to studying programming, databases and software project management. I am constantly seeking to keep up to date with technological trends in order to become a qualified professional in this area.

                As part of my future planning, I intend to take an English course to expand my opportunities in the job market, especially in a sector as globalized as IT. In addition, I am interested in specializing in other complementary areas, such as information security or mobile application development, always aiming for continuous growth.
